Your bus coordinators will be checking IDs, and they will not be able to save a spot for you if you forget your ID. Because the bus is first come, first served, we recommend getting to your pickup spot early during the check in process. Buses depart 30 minutes after check-in begins or until spots are filled, whichever is first. Times on this page are tentative until February 1st.

      We are running free buses from locations in California, and we would like you to offer a spot on one :) Buses leave on Friday morning and return Sunday night. If you would like a spot on the bus listed below, you must RSVP on this page by 
      <strong>
        November 27, 2048 8:39 PM PST
      </strong>
      . The bus will be first come, first served, but this shows us approximately how many seats we need. If you do not fill out this form, you will 
      <u>
        <strong>
          not
        </strong>
      </u>
       be allowed to board the bus. Because you are near a bus, we do not anticipate offering you other travel reimbursement options.
    </p>
    <p
      style="max-width:575px;margin:20px auto 0"
    >
      You 
      <u>
        <strong>
          must
        </strong>
      </u>
       have a 
      <u>
        <strong>
          government-issued ID
        </strong>
      </u>
       to get on the bus (this is because you must have one to check-in at TreeHacks!). Your bus coordinators will be checking IDs, and they will not be able to save a spot for you if you forget your ID. Because the bus is first come, first served, we recommend getting to your pickup spot early during the check in process. Buses depart 30 minutes after check-in begins or until spots are filled, whichever is first. Times on this page are tentative until February 1st.

        We recommend flying into SJC, SFO, or OAK; these are the closest  airports to Stanford (in that order). Please arrange for transportation  to bring you to the venue from the airport on Friday afternoon. Plan for your flight to arrive Friday afternoon by 3pm. This will allow  for you to get to Stanford on time for dinner and other goodies we have  planned. On Sunday, expect to leave the venue around 4pm, after closing ceremony.

        We have calculated your reimbursement amount based on the location in your application. We will reimburse the cost of your travel, up to this amount. It is up to you to decide how you get to Stanford, whether that's driving, public transportation, or another method. You must upload your receipts by the deadline listed on this page, or we will not be able to process your reimbursement.

          If you do not upload your receipts by the deadline, we will assume you are declining the reimbursement, and you will not be reimbursed.

        We recommend flying into SJC, SFO, or OAK; these are the closest  airports to Stanford (in that order). Please arrange for transportation  to bring you to the venue from the airport on Friday afternoon. Plan for your flight to arrive Friday afternoon by 3pm. This will allow  for you to get to Stanford on time for dinner and other goodies we have  planned. On Sunday, expect to leave the venue around 4pm, after closing ceremony.

        In the case that your current flight cap prevents you from attending TreeHacks or is significantly off the mark of flight prices that you're able to find, please reach out to us at hello@treehacks.com,  and we will work something out. Our hope is to remove any and all  barriers that could prevent you from coming out to TreeHacks!
